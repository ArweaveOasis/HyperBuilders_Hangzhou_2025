# <Aeternum>

## 简介
I'm going to build a immutable storage vault for brands like Dior, Chanel, and more, who values brand heritage and design archive 
to store their years of design work on Arweave, for Arweave is famous for their decentralization, security, and an immutable storage chain, 
this project will link real world assets from the culture and art to the web3 world, my project starts by building archive vault 
for luxurious fashion houses, but eventually will serve the similar needs to art museums and auction institutions 
like Christy’s and Sotheby’s in the future. 

Now, to achieve this goal, we will start by creating a website, and the website will showcasing nicely designed vaults for brands 
like Dior, Chanel, and more, each stored on arweave, and clients, such as designers, brand loyal customers, 
who would like to get access to the specific brand heritage will purchase an access key, say, a monthly subscription, 
or they can purchase subscriptions to all the brands on the website, only by a small amount of increasing subscription fee, 
to unencrypted the vault and view all listed brands.
 
To achieve this goal, I will need first to create a wallet connect to access to Arweave, and that will later on lead to our website preview,
by showcasing a very simple hello world message to keep a web3 project status, and we will build connectivity to prove that our website 
reads data from Arweave, and then, I will upload few fashion images or designs as the samples data from the company end, say, 
Dior, to Ardrive to make sure this project is a Ardrive native, and will leave protocols to make polish for later
