## 简介

This multi-party debate system allows users to define their own roles and conduct debates on the blockchain, helping creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators gain insights from multiple perspectives in an environment of uncertainty. Its transparent and verifiable process enhances decision-making clarity and increases the value of innovation. Furthermore, it provides an unlimited, canvas-like space for information storage and sharing. The semi-open architecture offers more opportunities for secondary creation, facilitating user engagement and retention.

## 演示 
1. Input Stage: Users input their vague or specific thoughts, serving as the starting point of the entire interaction. 
Value: Helps users transform their "subconscious thoughts" into "explicit text," completing the first step of self-expression.
2. Debate Stage (Dual-Role AI): Users define two AI roles, allowing them to debate the same input.
Key Point: The debate has no "outcome"; its purpose is to stimulate contradictions, conflicts, and diverse perspectives. 
Value: Breaks down users' existing thought patterns and provides intellectual stimulation.
3. Reflection Stage: Based on the debate process, users write down their reflections or insights. 
Value: Internalizes external stimuli (AI dialogue) into personal cognitive updates.
4. Infinite Canvas Recording:
Starting from the first element, users can expand upwards/downwards/left/right. 
Value: Not just a linear timeline, but a spatial, networked thought structure.
