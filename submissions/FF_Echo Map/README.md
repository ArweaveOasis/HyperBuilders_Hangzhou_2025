# Echo Map

## 简介

This multi-party debate system allows users to define their own roles and conduct debates on the blockchain, helping creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators gain insights from multiple perspectives in an environment of uncertainty. Its transparent and verifiable process enhances decision-making clarity and increases the value of innovation. Furthermore, it provides an unlimited, canvas-like space for information storage and sharing. The semi-open architecture offers more opportunities for secondary creation, facilitating user engagement and retention.

## 产品

Users begin by customizing a Debater AI, engaging in simulated debates where questions are posed and multiple perspectives collide. This process helps them break down complex issues, gain clarity, and form stronger self-awareness and decision-making references.

After the debate, users enter the Infinite Canvas: every choice and every thought recorded transforms into a new canvas block, expanding freely in four directions, gradually forming a personalized map of ideas.

Debater AI: offers external perspectives and multidimensional support
Infinite Canvas: captures the user’s final choices, paths, and traces of thought

Color-Coded Map: different colors represent themes of interest, cognitive tendencies, or value dimensions. As the canvas expands, a unique spectrum of colors emerges.

When multiple users’ canvases are placed side by side, their color patterns act as a metaphorical labeling system, enabling interest-based and cognitive-structure-based matching and connection.
Thus, the product is not only a debate arena powered by intelligent dialogue and a space for extending personal cognition, but also evolves into a decentralized social network of interests and ideas.

## 演示 
1. Input Stage: Users input their vague or specific thoughts, serving as the starting point of the entire interaction. 
Value: Helps users transform their "subconscious thoughts" into "explicit text," completing the first step of self-expression.
2. Debate Stage (Dual-Role AI): Users define two AI roles, allowing them to debate the same input.
Key Point: The debate has no "outcome"; its purpose is to stimulate contradictions, conflicts, and diverse perspectives. 
Value: Breaks down users' existing thought patterns and provides intellectual stimulation.
3. Reflection Stage: Based on the debate process, users write down their reflections or insights. 
Value: Internalizes external stimuli (AI dialogue) into personal cognitive updates.
4. Infinite Canvas Recording:
Starting from the first element, users can expand upwards/downwards/left/right. 
Value: Not just a linear timeline, but a spatial, networked thought structure.
